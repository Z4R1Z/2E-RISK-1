x# 2E-RISK
---------------------------------------- 

We intend to implement few new ideas that changes the units, the behavior of the territories, and the dice system that units use for attacking and defending. We also plan to add new units that can support the base units in the Risk. These ideas are as following: 

Base Units of Risk: Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery 

*Attack and Defense Parameters for Units: The idea is to give each unit an attack and defense parameter so that each unit has their unique parameter. For example, while infantries (knights (main defense) and troopers (main attack)) have medium attack and defense, artilleries have very high attack and very low defense, and cavalries have high attack and low defense point. 

*Research Team: Base units are not enough to win a war. These research team unlocks a new research node in the new research tree which increases selected parameters of the units. 

*Generals: Each country has a leader for them who can increase their one unitâ€™s (I.e only infantry) parameters. 

*Double Down: When you feel like you can get a higher die from the one you got, you can choose to double down. The general idea is that when you choose to double down, you roll the die again and if you got at least double the value of the previous die, you get an attack boost on top of the higher value, but if you get unlucky and do not get a higher die, you lose all your attack for that round. 

*Fort: When you feel like you are in danger, you can choose to fort your territory. Although this can give your territory defense boost, it also takes a few rounds to build and few rounds to mobilize the troops.
